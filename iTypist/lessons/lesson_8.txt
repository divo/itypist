T:            THE BACKSPACE
 :
 :Most of the programs that you use will allow you to correct your mistakes by
 :using the BACKSPACE and/or DELETE keys.  These keys will generally delete the
 :previous character that you typed.  (This feature is one of the principal
 :advantages of a word-processing system over a conventional typewriter.)
 :
 :I refuse to accept either of these keys during a drill pattern.  (You should
 :keep practicing until you get it right!)  But, I will accept either a BACK-
 :SPACE or a DELETE during a speed drill.  (I will remove the white error
 :markers but I still count it as an error in my totals.)
 :
 :If you do chose to use the DELETE or BACKSPACE keys, hit the key with your
 :;-finger and immediately return your fingers to the home position.
