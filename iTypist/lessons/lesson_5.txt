T:            SPEED EXERCISES
 :
 :From now on, I will be mixing speed exercises in with the lessons.  In the
 :drills that you have been doing, I make you keep practicing a line until
 :you get it right.  In a speed exercise, I will only display the text once.
 :
 :What will be different is that I will be timing you.  From the time you type
 :the first letter of the line until you hit the final carriage return, my
 :stopwatch will be running.  When you finish, I will calculate your typing speed
 :and convert it to words per minute (WPM).  I will also count each of the
 :mistakes you make and display the total number of errors.
 :
 :If you make a mistake, I will beep at you and light up the letter that you
 :should have typed in inverse video (a black letter on a white background).
 :Just keep going and try to make as few errors as possible.

I:Try this sentence:
*:_T_R_L77
S:Sarah has liked knitting all her life.

I:Try a little longer sentence.
*:_T_R_L78
S:She looked past her garden to the fields and longed to see the other side.

I:When you type a multi-line paragraph, you will have to hit the RETURN-key at
 :the end of each line.
*:_T_R_L79
S:All the sane people in this area sold their gold
 :right at the start.  The insane ones held their
 :gold and later it paid off.

*:_T_R_L80
S:One fine afternoon the king had an idea.  He
 :sent a letter to all the lords and ladies of
 :his land.  He asked for a great feast.  His
 :people prepared roasts.  His jester did a jig.
 :All the people left hoping to do it again.
