T:
 :In this lesson we will be practicing the shifted numeric keys on the
 :terminal keyboard.  I will only be giving you practice in the keystroke
 :motions.  Very few sentence drills or speed exercises are included, since these
 :keys are used so infrequently.
 :
 :If you are typing something which includes one of these special characters and
 :you cannot remember where a key is, look.  But, always make sure to hit the key
 :with the correct finger.  (If you do use the key often, you will eventually
 :learn where it is without looking.)  Since these keys are used infrequently and
 :are in different places on most other keyboards or are totally missing, speed
 :is not important.

I:Use your S-finger for the at-sign.

D:sss s@s sss s@s sss s@s sss

*:_T_R_L219
D:s@s at@ s@s w@x s@s S@w s@s
 :s@s wax s@s mix s@s @we s@s

I:Use your D-finger for the pound-sign (also called the number-sign).
*:_T_R_L220
D:ddd d#d ddd d#d ddd d#d ddd

*:_T_R_L221
D:d#d d#e d#d 3#c d#d #c# d#d
 :d#d cat d#d dog d#d eat d#d

I:Use your F-finger for the dollar-sign.
*:_T_R_L222
D:fff f$f fff f$f fff f$f fff

*:_T_R_L223
D:f$f r$v f$f v$4 f$f 4$r f$f
 :f$f rave f$f fare f$f $10.00 f$f
 :Joe keeps cryptic inventory bills like:  4# @ $5.00/# or 6# @ $4.50/#.

I:Use your F-finger for the percent sign as well.
*:_T_R_L224
D:fff f%f fff f%f fff f%f fff

*:_T_R_L225
D:f%f 12% f%f 10% f%f 20% f%f
 :f%f two f%f ran f%f bug f%f
 :If a $25.00 item is sold at a 10% discount, it will cost $22.50.
 :But, a 10% markup on a item selling for $22.50 is only $24.75!  How come?

I:Use your J-finger for the ampersand.
*:_T_R_L226
D:jjj j&j jjj j&j jjj j&j jjj

*:_T_R_L227
D:j&j 2&4 j&j 9&5 j&j 7&7 j&j

*:_T_R_L228
D:j&j you&me j&j he&she j&j M&M j&j

T:                THE END
 :
 :You have now completed the T-series of these lessons.  If you have not already
 :done so, you should now start the N-series or S-series.
 :
 :There are a few keys which we have not studied.  If you decide to touch-type
 :these keys, use the closest finger.  Thus, the ESC, TAB, CAPS LOCK, and SCROLL
 :keys use the A-finger.  And, the keys to the far right (BACKSPACE, DELETE, LINE
 :FEED, RETURN, }, {, etc.) use the ;-finger.  The upper keys (f1, f2, etc.) are
 :not usually touch typed as the reach is too far.  If you can, fine.
 :
 :The CONTROL and REPEAT keys are difficult to touch type, but are treated like
 :the SHIFT keys whenever possible.  For example, to REPEAT an exclamation point,
 :hold the REPEAT key down with your ;-finger and then hit the ! with your A-
 :finger.  Certain command sequences, such as Control/S, are hard to do this way.
 :Many people simply hold the CONTROL-key down with their A-finger and then hit
 :the other key with whatever finger is convenient (usually the F-finger in this
 :case).
